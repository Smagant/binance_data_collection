# binance_data_collection (version 0.0.1)

The goal of this repo is to propose a collection of tools for collecting data from the Binance API with different programming languages (for now only python is proposed). Each program has one task and one task only : Collect the data and store it to a file. No data cleaning is done to don't loose any information and give the full dataset for any further analysis.

### List of script to collect data :
* binance_get_historical_klines.ipynb : Python script to collect Kline/Candlestick data for one or multiple cryptocurrencies at once and save them seperately in different csv files if needed.
